1.83	- Things now work again on Windows 2000.
	- Python bindings bug fixes.
	- Improved python error handling.
	- Added interceptor and symbolicexecutor scripts.

1.82	- Better handling of breakpoints.
	- Fix thread suspend issues while handling breakpoints.
	- Reintroduced the python shell.
	- Updated Python to 2.7.1
	- Fixed python tracebacks to work again.

1.81
	- EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE can now be ignored.
	  This will work properly, unless the end-user uses on-access
	  breakpoints which use guard pages (this principle is broken
	  anyhow, as passing guard pages to system functions can lead
	  to undesired side effects).

	- Every python script and hook now runs in its own python interpreter
	  instance.  This prevents scripts and hooks cluttering a shared
	  environment.

	- Fixed memory corruption issues when loading .sys files.

	- SYS files can be loaded into the debugger again.

	- LOADDLL.EXE works again.

	- Fixed pathname handling.  The debugger can now use python scripts
	  and hooks when running in JID mode.

	- ID can now be installed in different paths without giving people
	  trouble.

	- Added acrocache.py for dumping information related to the Adobe
	  Acrobat Reader heap

	- Added searchspray.py for finding repeating heap sprayed patterns in
	  memory.

	- The expression class in prettysolver.py allows for easy manipulation
	  of SMT formulae using native Python operations. 

	- Fixed a bug in safeseh.py when the module was not specified
	
	- Minor bug fixes in the x86smt and deplib scripts

	- Updated the documentation.

1.80 
	- Analysis engine for converting x86 code to SMT formulae (see
	  Libs/x86smt/sequenceanalyzer.py). For now we use CVC3 to provide the
	  backend SMT solver API. (You must add Libs/x86smt/ to your PATH as
	  two required dlls reside there). 

	- Preliminary DEPLIB v2 scripts built on top of the above analysis
	  engine for finding ROP gadgets (see PyCommands/deplib/findpivot.py
	  and PyCommands/deplib/find_gadget.py). 

	- Early versions of libraries for building static analysis tools on
	  top of ID (See Libs/pathgenerator.py). These are independent of the
	  x86smt libraries but combinations of both can work well (see
	  Libs/x86smt/pathwalker.py, PyCommands/x86smt/find_int_overflow.py
	  and PyCommands/pathogen.py). 

	- The advertisements have been tamed somewhat and have a 78% lower
	  chance of popping out and tearing your eyes out. 

	- Lots of other cleanups and annoyance removals that we didn't make
	  note of but probably should have for a more impressive looking 'Bug
	  Fixes' list.

1.74
	o Moved project to a new build system. 
	
	o Fixed a number of bugs in how PyCommands are run. Threaded 
	scripts are now supported but they pause the debugger while 
	running. A future release will have proper support for 
	daemon-isable Python scripts. To view exceptions raised by 
	a child-thread create an instance of the immlib.StderrToLog
	class in your PyCommand script. This will redirect exceptions
	to the log window. 

	o Changed the naming scheme for all functions in the 'debugger'
	Python/C module. All functions in this module now follow the 
	lower_case_functions K&R style.

	o All functions in the 'immlib' module should now use the 
	camelCase naming scheme. e.g. imm.Log is now imm.log, 
	imm.getModulebyAddress is now imm.getModuleByAddress and so on.

	o Removed the PyScripts method of running Python code. All
	functionality can be accessed through PyCommands.

	o Fixed minor bugs and usability issues in a number of the Python 
	scripts including heap.py, lookaside.py, shellcodediff.py, 
	hookndr.py and syscall.py.
